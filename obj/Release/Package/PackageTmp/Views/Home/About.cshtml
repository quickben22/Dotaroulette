<h3>The goal</h3>
<br />
<p>The purpose of this web page is to make the team searching process a bit less painful. </p>
<p>
    If you are not lucky enough to have 5 real life friends who enjoy playing dota 2 as much as you do, then
    you are forced to find a team through different means. Most common way is to search with internet, or
    more precicely through different kinds of forums.
    If you have ever tried to find a team this way, you are probably aware how hard that process can be.
    The process of trying out for a team, or forming a team and searching for teammates is extremely
    time consuming, and often frustrating, both for the team recruiting, and for the player applying.
    Also there are always much more players searching for a team, then there are teams searching for players.
    So why wouldn't these random players form a team themself, instead of searching for a team? Well this application
    allows just that. All you have to do is fill out the basic information about yourself, and information concerning
    what you are looking for in a team, and press search. If there are 4 players in a search pool whose requirements
    you meet, and they meet your requirements you will automatically form a team. After that you will get contact
    information of all your teammates, and that is all, everything else is left to 5 of you. Maybe you'll win the
    next International, maybe you'll disband after a week.

<h3>How to use</h3>
<br />
<p>
    There are 2 ways to use this application. 
    <ul>
        <li>1. You can search for a team as a solo player searching for a team . To use this option you need to fill out some basic information
        in your profile section and press the button <b>(Search as solo)</b>.</li>
        <li>2. The second option is to create a team, invite your friends in the team, and then search for missing team members. To use this option you must 
        first fill out some basic information in your profile section. After that click a button <b>"create a team"</b>, and start inviting team members to a team.
        After you have some team members there will be a new button on the home page <b>(Search as a team)</b>, and by pressing this button the application will 
        try to automaticaly fill out the missing players in your team (from the search pool).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<br />
<p>
    The motivation for building this app was mostly because I felt it could be useful to many people. I don’t have much
    experience in web development, so it was also a good exercise, and opportunity to learn something new. This
    application was built with Microsoft's MVC 5.
